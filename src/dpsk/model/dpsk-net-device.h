 * DpskNetDevice), the class models, with some level of
 * abstraction, a generic point-to-point or serial link.
 * Key parameters or objects that can be specified for this device
 * include a queue, data rate, and interframe transmission gap (the
 * propagation delay is set in the DpskChannel).
 *
 * Different from PointToPointNetDevice, Dpsk device can be
 * programmed by the user.
